# WHUCAD

WHUCAD is the first full parametric and feature-based CAD dataset to support HCI in 3D learning, and therefore can generate CAD models with real-world engineering features as advanced as that created by human engineers.

A gallery of WHUCAD dataset is shown above.

WHUCAD dataset and all code will be available only upon the acceptance of this paper "WHUCAD: A parametric and feature-based CAD dataset to support human-computer interaction for advanced 3D shape learning".
